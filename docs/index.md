# Introduction

Thank you for choosing **Snippets** - your fastest path to creating expressive 3D characters that talk, move, and engage your audience in minutes.

Snippets helps you save valuable time by eliminating the complexity of facial animation workflows. With our intuitive web platform and powerful SDK integration, you can generate lifelike, animated character content in just a few clicks.

## What Are Snippets?

A **Snippet** is a self-contained unit that combines:

- **Voice audio**
- **Visemes** (facial shapes for mouth movement)
- **Prebaked character animation**

The result is a **talking 3D character** that's ready to be dropped straight into your Unity project. You no longer need to manually animate dialogue or sync audio - Snippets does it all for you.

Snippets are grouped into **Snippet Sets**, which act as project folders that you later import directly via our SDK.

## General Flow

Here's how the typical workflow goes:

### How It Works

1. **Create a Snippet Set**  
   Start your project by generating a Snippet Set. Each snippet includes synced audio, viseme data, and 3D animation ready for Unity. Support for other engines is coming soon.

2. **Publish**  
   Finalize your Snippet Set and click **“Publish”** to make it available through the Snippets SDK.

3. **Import into your app (Via SDK)**  
   Use the Unity SDK to import your published Snippet Set into your app or game with a single click.

4. **Update Anytime**  
   To make changes, edit your snippets in the web portal and re-publish. Click **“Update”** in the SDK to fetch the latest version into your project.
