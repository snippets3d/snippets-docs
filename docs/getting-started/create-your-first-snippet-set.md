### Option 1: Paste Script

This lets you input a script that the character will speak **word-for-word**.


---

### Option 2: Generate with AI

This option allows you to provide a **prompt**, and our AI will generate a script based on your input.

Example prompt:
> *"Teach me how to bake a cake."*

The system will create a series of snippets containing relevant information about the topic.

You can also control the **duration** of your snippet set using the slider provided.

### Option 3: Create from Audio *(Coming Soon)*

This upcoming feature allows you to upload an **audio file**, and Snippets3D will automatically create a snippet based on the audio provided.
