## Snippet

A **Snippet** is a unit of dialogue animation. It typically includes:

- Audio
- Visemes (mouth shapes for lip-syncing)
- Animation data (such as gestures or expressions)

Snippets are the core building blocks for creating interactive character dialogue.

## Snippet Set

A **Snippet Set** is a collection of related Snippets. This serves as your **project folder**, which groups all relevant dialogue assets together.

You can import an entire Snippet Set into your Unity project using the SDK. This makes it easier to manage and reuse your content across different applications or scenes.
